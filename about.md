I'm a Software Engineer at <a href="https://media.net" target="_blank" class="link">Media.net</a>, building intelligent throttling systems for network path optimization.

Before joining IIIT Delhi, I was a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://practo.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Practo</a>, solving healthcare domain problems. I worked with the data science team, which interested me in Machine Learning. I have been teaching myself about its practical and research aspects ever since.

I've contributed to Open Source for nearly 8 years now and have been involved with organizations such as <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs" target="_blank" class="link">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://duckduckhack.com/u/manrajgrover/" target="_blank" class="link">DuckDuckGo</a>, and <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/manrajsingh/" target="_blank" class="link">Mozilla</a>. Over the past few years, some of my side projects attracted great attention, which got them on the GitHub Trending list. I've also mentored students during <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6561581775716352/" target="_blank" class="link">Google Summer of Code, 2019</a>, <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/" target="_blank" class="link">Google Code-In, 2017</a>, and <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/" target="_blank" class="link">Rails Girls Summer of Code, 2018</a>.

I studied Instrumentation and Control Engineering at the <a href="http://www.nsit.ac.in/" target="_blank" class="link">University of Delhi</a>, where my thesis advisor was <a href="http://www.nsit.ac.in/faculty/prg/" target="_blank" class="link">Dr. Prerna Gaur</a>. During my studies, alongside Open Source Code contributions, I was actively involved in Mozilla's regional community as a Core Contributor. I was invited to attend Mozilla Leadership Summit, where I got the opportunity to understand Mozilla's vision, shape strategy to grow the community, and hone my leadership skills. Leading the IEEE college chapter holding general secretary helped me experience and learn from the dynamics of planning, budgeting, and organizing regional and college events.
