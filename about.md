I'm a Research Assistant at IIIT Delhi, India under <a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn" target="_blank" class="link">Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah</a>, building automated systems in education domain.

Before joining IIIT Delhi, I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Practo](https://practo.com/) solving healthcare related problems. I worked with the datascience team which got me interested in Machine Learning and have been teaching myself about its practical and research aspects ever since.

I've been contributing to Open Source for close to 5 years now and been actively involved with organizations such as [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckhack.com/u/manrajgrover/), and [Mozilla](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/manrajsingh/) and currently heavily involved in building [TensorFlowJS](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) and it's ecosystem. Over the past few years, some of my side project like [halo](https://github.com/manrajgrover/halo), [SingleDivProject](https://github.com/manrajgrover/SingleDivProject), [football-cli](https://github.com/manrajgrover/football-cli) and [organize-cli](https://github.com/manrajgrover/organize-cli) attracted great attention which got them on Github Trending list. I've also mentored students during [Google Code-In, 2017](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/) and [Rails Girls Summer of Code, 2018](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/).

I've studied [Instrumentation and Control Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_and_control_engineering) at [University of Delhi](http://www.nsit.ac.in/). During my studies, alongside Open Source Code contributions, I was actively involved in Mozilla's regional community as a Core Contributor and was invited to attend Mozilla Leadership Summit where I got the opportunity to understand Mozilla's vision, shape strategy to grow the community and hone my leadership skills. Leading IEEE college chapter holding general secretary helped me experience and learn from the dynamics of planning, budgeting, and organizing regional and college events.
