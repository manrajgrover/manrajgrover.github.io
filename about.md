I currently serve as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://media.net" target="_blank" class="link">Media.net</a>, where my focus lies in developing intelligent traffic throttling systems.

Prior to joining Media.net, I held the role of Research Associate at <a href="https://midas.iiitd.ac.in/" target="_blank" class="link">MIDAS Lab, IIIT Delhi</a>, delving into the automation of grading systems for speech and text responses. Notably, I spearheaded the development of an end-to-end pipeline catering to a prominent company's recruitment process, assessing candidates' L2 English skills.

Previously, my tenure as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://practo.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Practo</a> involved addressing challenges within the healthcare domain. Collaborating closely with the data science team sparked my interest in Machine Learning, leading me to pursue self-directed learning in its practical and research facets.

My involvement in Open Source initiatives spans nearly 8 years, during which I've partnered with renowned organizations such as <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs" target="_blank" class="link">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo" target="_blank" class="link">DuckDuckGo</a>, and <a href="https://people.mozilla.org/p/manrajsingh" target="_blank" class="link">Mozilla</a>. Several of my side projects garnered significant attention, earning placements on GitHub's Trending list. Additionally, I've had the privilege of mentoring students in esteemed programs including <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6561581775716352/" target="_blank" class="link">Google Summer of Code (2019)</a>, <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/" target="_blank" class="link">Google Code-In (2017)</a>, and <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/" target="_blank" class="link">Rails Girls Summer of Code (2018)</a>.

My academic journey includes a degree in Instrumentation and Control Engineering from the <a href="http://www.nsit.ac.in/" target="_blank" class="link">University of Delhi</a>. Alongside academic pursuits, I actively contributed to Open Source initiatives and played a pivotal role in Mozilla's regional community as a Core Contributor. Attending the Mozilla Leadership Summit provided invaluable insights into community growth strategies and facilitated the enhancement of my leadership skills. Serving as the general secretary of the IEEE college chapter further enriched my experiences, offering firsthand exposure to event planning, budgeting, and organization dynamics.
